Selected optimization level O1:  Insert automatic casts around Pytorch functions and Tensor methods.
Defaults for this optimization level are:
enabled                : True
opt_level              : O1
cast_model_type        : None
patch_torch_functions  : True

Warning:  multi_tensor_applier fused unscale kernel is unavailable, possibly because apex was installed without --cuda_ext --cpp_ext. Using Python fallback.  Original ImportError was: ModuleNotFoundError("No module named 'amp_C'")
Warning:  apex was installed without --cpp_ext.  Falling back to Python flatten and unflatten.
